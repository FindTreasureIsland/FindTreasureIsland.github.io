## Ongoing Research Projects

### Temporal Dynamics of Attention in Visual Search
This project aims to explain the temporal dynamics of visual search manifested across multiple levels of neural signals and behavior.

### Personalization and Learning
Personalization algorithms produce recommendations on many online services that are fine-tuned to individual users. They have been discussed as a possible reason of intellectual isolation and reinforcement of one's belief. This project aims to study the influence of personalization on category knowledge in a controlled experiment.

## General Research Interests
 * Computational cognitive modeling, model-based cognitive neuroscience
 * Concepts, categories, semantics, and their interactions with higher-order cognition
 * Temporal dynamics of learning, decision-making, and inferences
 * Human-algorithm interaction
 * Active learning
