## Description

Personalization algorithms produce recommendations on many online services that are fine-tuned to individual users. They have been discussed as a possible reason of intellectual isolation and reinforcement of oneâ€™s belief. This project aims to study the influence of personalization on category knowledge in a controlled experiment.

[^1]: The acknowledged aim of the book is to dwarf all other books in the field.
[^2]: As a result of such intensive research, the book's length is almost twelve hundred pages.
