## Description

Personalization algorithms produce recommendations on many online services that are fine-tuned to individual users. They have been discussed as a possible reason of *filter bubbles* that cause intellectual isolation and reinforcement of oneâ€™s belief. This project studies the influence of personalization on category knowledge in a controlled experiment.
