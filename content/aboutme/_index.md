I am a postdoctoral researcher of CATLAB (Category Laboratory) in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt University. Here, I investigated how a cognitive model of visual attention can bridge neurophysiological and electrophysiological signals manifesting visual search processes.

I received my Masters in Psychology degree in Seoul National University under the supervision of Dr. Jooyong Park, studying analogical reasoning and problem-solving processes. I received my Ph.D. in Psychology from The Ohio State University (OSU) in 2021, under the supervision of Dr. Brandon Turner. My research at OSU was centered around a joint modeling framework that incorporates neural and behavioral data to explain cognitive processes, and how category learning in an interactive but biased environment (mis)guides representational learning.

My research focuses on how our thought processes interact with categorical knowledge and processes associated category learning like attention and information search. I am particularly interested in how such interactive processes are unfold over time in a dynamic, interactive environment. I'm also interested in how cognitive models can bridge multiple levels of data manifesting the same cognitive processes. I use experimentation, computational cognitive modeling, Bayesian methods, and machine learning approaches.
