## Research
I am a postdoctoral researcher of CATLAB (Category Laboratory) in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt University. Here, I investigated how a cognitive model of visual attention can bridge neurophysiological and electrophysiological signals manifesting visual search processes.

I received my Masters in Psychology degree in Seoul National University under the supervision of Dr. Jooyong Park, studying analogical reasoning and problem-solving processes. I received my Ph.D. in Psychology from The Ohio State University (OSU) in 2021, under the supervision of Dr. Brandon Turner. My research at OSU was centered around a joint modeling framework that incorporates neural and behavioral data to explain cognitive processes, and how category learning in an interactive but biased environment (mis)guides representational learning.

My research focuses on how our thought processes interact with categorical knowledge and processes associated category learning like attention and information search. I am particularly interested in how such interactive processes are unfold over time in a dynamic, interactive environment. I'm also interested in how cognitive models can bridge multiple levels of data manifesting the same cognitive processes. I use experimentation, computational cognitive modeling, Bayesian methods, and machine learning approaches.

## Skills
 * Programming languages: [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
 * Bayesian statistics and data analysis: Stan
 * Machine learning and neural network modeling libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow
 * Containerization: Docker, Singularity

## Teaching
In general, I am interested in applying teaching methods guiding students to actively explore problems and express their thoughts in writing. The topics and domains of my interest in teaching are as follows:

 * Research methods and experimental design
 * Introductory (Bayesian) statistics
 * Cognitive psychology
 * Computational cognitive modeling

### Bayesian inference and statistics
I have led a five-week hands-on Bayesian inference ([Category Laboratory](http://catlab.psy.vanderbilt.edu/), Vanderbilt University). The workshop covered how to do Bayesian statistical modeling (e.g., group comparison, linear regression, generalized linear models) using R and Stan. 

You can find R markdown notes for the workshop [**here**](https://github.com/giwonbahg/handson-bayes/tree/main).
