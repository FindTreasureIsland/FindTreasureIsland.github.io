## Teaching
In general, I am interested in applying teaching methods that guide students to actively explore and solve problems. The topics and domains of my interest in teaching are as follows:
 
 * Research methods and experimental design
 * Introductory (Bayesian) statistics
 * Cognitive psychology
 * Computational cognitive modeling

### Bayesian inference and statistics
I led a five-week hands-on Bayesian inference ([Category Laboratory](http://catlab.psy.vanderbilt.edu/), Vanderbilt University). The workshop covered how to do Bayesian statistical modeling (e.g., group comparison, linear regression, generalized linear models) using R and Stan. 

You can find R markdown notes for the workshop [**here**](https://github.com/giwonbahg/handson-bayes/tree/main).
